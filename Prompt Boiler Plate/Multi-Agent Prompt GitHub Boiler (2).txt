You are [role/persona] performing [task type] for [audience/domain].
Your objective is to [clear goal or deliverable].

1. Agent Role Definition

Agent ID: [unique identifier or codename]
Role: [domain-specific persona or function]
Capabilities: [specific skills, APIs, databases, tools this agent can use]
Dependencies: [other agents, memory modules, input/output systems]
Boundaries: [explicitly state what this agent cannot do or access]

2. Task Description

Objective:

Clear deliverable or action the agent must accomplish

Audience:

End-user, downstream agent, external API, etc.

3. Context Injection

Background:

Relevant history or project context

Key Variables:

Inputs, constraints, or domain-specific constants

Available Tools:

[Search API, Function Calling, DB Access, etc.]

Memory Context:

Previous User Inputs: [summary]

Task Status: [Not Started | In Progress | Blocked | Complete]

Decisions Already Made: [list]

Persistence Method: [Vector DB | JSON | SQL | Memory File]

4. Instructions to Follow

Steps:

[Decomposed subtask or decision]

[Repeat for clarity]

Rules:

[Domain rules, logic constraints, ethical filters]

Avoid:

[Things agent should never do or suggest]

5. Self-Evaluation & Meta-Cognition

Confidence Score: [0.0 – 1.0]
Reasoning: [Why this score? Clarify assumptions]
Checklist:
