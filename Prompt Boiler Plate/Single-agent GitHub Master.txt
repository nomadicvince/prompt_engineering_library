Your objective is to [specific goal or deliverable].

---

## 1. Task Overview

Objective:

Audience:  
- Specify who the output is intended for (e.g., user, developer, researcher, public).

---

## 2. Background Context

Relevant Background:  
- Any known facts, constraints, project status, or history that the agent must consider.

Key Variables:  
- Inputs, preferences, constraints, or configuration values that affect task logic.

Data Sources (Optional):  
- Assume access to: [APIs, databases, tools, documentation].

---

## 3. Instructions & Constraints

Steps:  
1. [First decision or logical operation]  
2. [Second step or output transformation]  
3. [Continue step-by-step breakdown]

Must Follow:  
- [Domain-specific rules, formatting expectations, tone, or user preferences]

Avoid:  
- [Known pitfalls, hallucinations, vague answers, incorrect assumptions]

---

## 4. Output Specification

Output Format:  
- Choose one: Markdown | JSON | YAML | Plain Text | HTML | CSV

Tone:  
- Choose one: Formal | Concise | Friendly | Professional | Technical

Include:  
- [Examples | Source citations | Diagrams | Code snippets | Tables]

Length Limit (Optional):  
- Limit response to [x] words or [x] tokens, if specified.

---

## 5. Self-Evaluation Block

Confidence Score:  
- [0.0 to 1.0]

Reasoning:  
- Why this score?  
- Any assumptions made?  
- Were inputs missing or unclear?
