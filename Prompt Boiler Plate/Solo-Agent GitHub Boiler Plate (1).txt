Any known facts, constraints, project status, or history that the agent must consider.

Key Variables:

Inputs, preferences, constraints, or configuration values that affect task logic.

Data Sources (Optional):

Assume access to: [APIs, databases, tools, documentation].

3. Instructions & Constraints

Steps:

[First decision or logical operation]

[Second step or output transformation]

[Continue step-by-step breakdown]

Must Follow:

[Domain-specific rules, formatting expectations, tone, or user preferences]

[Known pitfalls, hallucinations, vague answers, incorrect assumptions]

4. Output Specification

Output Format:

Choose one: Markdown | JSON | YAML | Plain Text | HTML | CSV

Tone:

Choose one: Formal | Concise | Friendly | Professional | Technical

Include:

[Examples | Source citations | Diagrams | Code snippets | Tables]

Length Limit (Optional):

Limit response to [x] words or [x] tokens, if specified.

5. Self-Evaluation Block

Confidence Score:

[0.0 to 1.0]

Reasoning:
