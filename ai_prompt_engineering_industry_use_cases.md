# Industry-Specific Prompt Engineering Use Cases

## 1. Travel & Hospitality
**Why this industry benefits:**  
Travel is increasingly personalized, with customers expecting AI-driven experiences tailored to their preferences, dietary needs, and niche interests. Prompt engineers help design queries that enable AI to act as a virtual travel agent, generating context-aware itineraries, hotel suggestions, and activity lists. A skilled prompt engineer ensures the AI accounts for regional holidays, visa requirements, accessibility, and nuanced traveler profiles like solo female travelers, backpackers, or high-end luxury seekers.

**Detailed Prompt:**  
"You are an AI-powered travel assistant. Create a detailed 7-day itinerary for a solo traveler visiting Lisbon in late October. The traveler is vegan, enjoys historical walking tours, boutique hotels, and wants to explore local music and art. The itinerary should include daily activity breakdowns with estimated travel times between locations, vegan-friendly restaurant options with links to menus, and cultural events taking place during the week. Prioritize safety, walkability, and authentic experiences over tourist traps. Present the plan in a bullet-point format grouped by day, followed by a packing suggestion list based on the forecasted weather."

## 2. Digital Marketing
**Why this industry benefits:**  
Marketing teams rely heavily on persuasive content generation, ad copy variation, SEO optimization, and dynamic personalization. Prompt engineering enhances creative ideation while maintaining consistent brand voice. By optimizing inputs for large language models, marketers can efficiently test multiple versions of copy, automate product descriptions, and even create personalized CTAs for different audience segments. Prompt engineers also help structure outputs for integration into CRM workflows and A/B testing platforms.

**Detailed Prompt:**  
"You are a senior copywriter at a digital marketing agency. Generate three variations of short-form ad copy (under 50 words) for a SaaS company offering automated invoice processing for small businesses. Highlight core benefits such as time savings, accuracy, and easy integration with QuickBooks. Each variation should target a different persona: 1) a time-strapped freelancer, 2) an office manager at a mid-sized firm, and 3) a startup founder. Incorporate urgency and a call to action. After the three versions, provide a rationale explaining the psychological tactic used in each (e.g., fear of loss, convenience, authority)."

## 3. Journalism & Media
**Why this industry benefits:**  
Journalists can leverage prompt engineering for tasks such as summarizing large datasets, converting press releases into articles, and brainstorming story angles. Well-structured prompts ensure the AI maintains journalistic integrity, avoids sensationalism, and adheres to AP style. Prompt engineers add value by training models to distinguish between editorial tone and breaking news tone, and can assist editors in building reusable templates for various beats (e.g., politics, tech, finance).

**Detailed Prompt:**  
"You are a news editor summarizing a 2,000-word press release from a major tech company about their new generative AI chip. Create a concise 300-word article suitable for publication in a digital news outlet targeting a tech-savvy audience. Highlight the technical specs, market positioning, and any direct quotes from the CEO or engineers.
